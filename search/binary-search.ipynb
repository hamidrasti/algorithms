    "\n",
    "Suppose he is only allowed to overturn 1 card per minute, it may take him 30 minutes to find the required card if 30 cards are laid out on the table. Is this the best he can do? Is a way for Bob to arrive at the answer by turning over just 5 cards, instead of 30?\n",

    "The field of study concerned with finding the amount of time, space or other resources required to complete the execution of computer programs is called _the analysis of algorithms_.

    "\n",
    "> **Complexity** of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size e.g. `N`. Unless otherwise stated, the term _complexity_ always refers to the worst-case complexity (i.e. the highest possible time/space taken by the program/algorithm to process an input).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of linear search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The _time complexity_ of the algorithm is `cN` for some fixed constant `c` that depends on the number of operations we perform in each iteration and the time taken to execute a statement. Time complexity is sometimes also called the _running time_ of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The _space complexity_ is some constant `c'` (independent of `N`), since we just need a single variable `position` to iterate through the array, and it occupies a constant space in the computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Big O Notation**: Worst-case complexity is often expressed using the Big O notation. In the Big O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of relationship between the size of the input and the complexity of the algorithm i.e. if the complexity of the algorithm is `cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f`, in the Big O notation it is expressed as **O(N^3)**\n",
